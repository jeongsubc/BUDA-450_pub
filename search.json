    "section": "1.2 What is Data Mining?",
    "text": "1.2 What is Data Mining?\n\n1.2.1 Fuels for the Information Age\nTo understand data mining, let’s first start by answering the question What exactly is data mining? There is a famous analogy from “Clive Humby, a British mathematician and entrepreneur, that said, ‘Data is the new oil.’ This analogy helps us understand why data mining is such a crucial process in the modern information age.\nWhat does that mean? Just like crude oil, raw data on its own isn’t very useful. Crude oil has to be refined into products like gasoline, plastic, or jet fuel to be valuable. Similarly, data has to be refined—through cleaning, processing, and analysis—before it generates value.\nThe Information Age has been built on this process. In the past, major waves of development were driven by steam, electricity, and oil. Now, computers, networks, and data form the foundation of progress. Think about it: every time you use Google Maps, watch Netflix, or buy something on Amazon, you’re experiencing data as fuel. Those companies don’t just store data—they refine it into insights: recommending the next show, predicting traffic, or suggesting products.\n\n\n1.2.2 Data Mining in Simple Terms\nAt its simplest, data mining means turning raw data into value. You can think of it as a process of discovering hidden patterns and relationships from data. In the process,\n\nData is the raw material. Think of sales receipts, website clicks, or medical records.\nMining is the process—digging into that data to find useful patterns. Just like miners dig into rock to find gold, we dig into data to find knowledge.\nValue is the outcome, as insights that help us make a difference such as better decisions, efficiency improvement, or predictions.\n\nHere’s a business example: imagine a supermarket chain. They have massive amounts of checkout data. By itself, it’s just numbers. But when mined, it might reveal that customers who buy diapers also buy beer. That insight has value—it can influence store layout or promotions.\nSo whenever you hear the term data mining, think: data goes in, and actionable value comes out. In short: data in, value out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThink of a situation: You’ve got tons of information, but it’s just sitting there. What’s one example where mining that information could turn it into value?\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Definition of Data Mining\nData mining is the knowledge discovery from data. It’s the process of extracting interesting patterns or knowledge from huge datasets.\nLet’s highlight a few key parts of that definition: - Interesting means non-trivial—it’s not something obvious. - It should be previously unknown. If everyone already knows it, it’s not knowledge discovery. - And it should be useful—either for making predictions, guiding strategy, or saving resources.\nData mining goes by other names too: knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), knowledge extraction, business intelligence, information harvesting. Besides, there are many but similar and related definitions of data mining, like data analysis and data dredging.\nBut, here, the important distinction is this: data mining is not about finding any pattern—it’s about finding meaningful and valid patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you notice that every morning the sun rises in the east, does that count as data mining? Why or why not? (Hint: it’s not new or unknown!)\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Foundations of Data Mining\nWe just started studying Data mining in this course, but data mining is not a brand-new discipline—it borrows from several established fields. Here are three major fields.\n\nDatabase systems and computing: Without advances in storing and managing large amounts of data, mining would not be possible. Think about SQL databases or distributed systems like Hadoop.\nStatistics: This provides the foundation for measurement, inference, and testing. For example, probability theory underlies many mining methods.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML): These give us algorithms that learn patterns from data, like decision trees, clustering, and neural networks.\n\nNow, we may have one following question: why do we need something beyond traditional statistics or databases? Because modern data has new challenges:\n\nIt’s complex—your task may involve not only well-structured tabular format but also, text, video, images, not just numbers. The traditional methods often are not suitable for data mining tasks with such complex data.\nSimilarly, modern data are often heterogeneous—as it may consist of different formats and sources.\nIn addition, data for your tasks may be at a large-scale with millions or billions of records, and high-dimensional with thousands of variables.\nFurthermore, data can be distributed as stored across many servers and locations.\n\nTraditional techniques simply weren’t built to handle this. Data mining techniques evolved to tackle exactly these challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCan you think of one dataset you’ve encountered—maybe in your work, studies, or even social media—that seems too big or too complex to handle with just Excel or basic statistics?",

    "section": "1.3 Why is data mining used?",
    "text": "1.3 Why is data mining used?\n\n1.3.1 Data and its Explosive Growth\nHere’s the big driver behind why data mining matters: the sheer explosion of data. Data is everywhere, and it keeps growing faster than we can imagine. This growth is driven by advances in:\n\nData generation – Every second, people are generating posts, clicks, videos, GPS pings, and transactions.\nData collection – Sensors, apps, and platforms record nearly everything.\nData storage – Cloud computing now makes it cheap to keep almost unlimited amounts of data.\n\nWe’ve moved from terabytes (10¹² bytes) to petabytes, exabytes, and now zettabytes (10¹⁸ bytes). To give you perspective, one zettabyte is a billion terabytes.\nThe sources of this data are diverse:\n\nBusiness: Online purchases, stock trades, loyalty cards.\nSociety: Social media posts, news feeds, YouTube uploads.\nScience: Remote sensing data from satellites, DNA sequencing, simulation models.\n\nLike these, nowadays, we can collect data nearly everywhere. Here, the reality is–—we’re in an era where we generate more data than we can manually process. That’s why data mining isn’t optional anymore; it’s necessary to make sense of the flood of information.\nExample: Domo’s annual Data Never Sleeps report shows that in just one minute, millions of emails are sent, hundreds of thousands of dollars are spent on e-commerce, and hours of video are uploaded to YouTube. This highlights the nonstop pace of data growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n‘Think about your own life for a moment—your phone, your social media, your browsing history. How much data do you think you generate in a single day? Is most of it being used, or just stored?’”\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Value from Data and Data Mining\nNow, here’s the critical point: while data is everywhere, value is not. Collecting data doesn’t guarantee it will be useful to create value. Keep in mind that our goal of data mining here is not to create data, but to create value. To achieve it, we can consider two main ways:\n\nFor its intended purpose.\n\nExample: a hospital records patient vital signs so doctors can monitor health.\n\nFor a new, unanticipated purpose.\n\nExample: analyzing purchase data not just for receipts, but to build customer recommendation systems.\n\n\nData mining is the bridge that transforms massive raw data into valuable insights. Then, what makes this possible today?\n\nFirst, we have now cheaper and more powerful computing. Cloud platforms and GPUs let us crunch massive datasets quickly.\nAt the same time, there are competitive pressure. Companies must use their data to stay ahead—think of how Netflix, Amazon, or Spotify personalize services to keep customers engaged.\n\nReal-world example: Netflix doesn’t just track what you watch; it tracks when you pause, when you stop, how often you binge, and even the time of day you watch. By do data mining, that raw data becomes insights that guide personalized recommendations and even influence what original shows they invest in. So the real message here is: without mining, data is just overhead. However, with data mining, it can become a strategic asset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHere’s a question: Can you think of an example where you know a company is using your data to give you personalized value—like a recommendation, an offer, or an alert? Did it feel helpful or a little creepy?",

    "text": "1.4 When/where is data mining needed?\n\n1.4.1 Process for DM\nData mining isn’t just one single action—it’s part of a larger process that requires careful planning and execution. At its core, data mining means examining large datasets to identify patterns and then using those patterns to generate valuable business insights. But if we just jump into modeling without structure, we risk wasting time or drawing wrong conclusions.\nThat’s why a systematic approach is critical. In industry, there are established standards with clearly defined steps, the two most popular being: - CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) - KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) process\nBoth provide a roadmap, ensuring that projects move from messy raw data to actionable insights in a repeatable and reliable way.\nAlso, remember that data mining is part of a broader data analytics ecosystem that includes machine learning, statistical analysis, and business intelligence tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nImagine you’re hired by a company that wants to reduce customer churn. What could go wrong if you just start building a model without following a systematic process?\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)\nCRISP-DM is one of the most widely used frameworks for data mining. It consists of six iterative steps:\n\nBusiness understanding – First, we define the context and objectives. What problem are we solving? For example: predicting loan defaults.\nData understanding – Collect raw data and perform preliminary analysis. What data do we have? What’s missing? What hypotheses are emerging?\nData preparation – Clean, transform, and preprocess data. This includes removing errors, handling missing values, and selecting useful variables.\nModeling – Apply appropriate data mining techniques, like classification, clustering, or regression.\nEvaluation – Assess the models. Are the results valid? Do they answer the business question? If not, we loop back.\nDeployment – Translate results into actionable insights or strategies. For example: build a dashboard, send alerts, or automate decision rules.\n\nIt’s important to note that CRISP-DM is not linear. Analysts often move back and forth between stages as new discoveries are made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n‘Looking at these six steps, which do you think might take the most time in a real project: modeling or data preparation?’ (Hint: in practice, data preparation usually eats up the majority of time!)”\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Knowledge Discovery (KDD) Process\nThe KDD process is another structured framework, often discussed in academic and research communities, especially those focused on databases and data warehousing. The KDD steps look very similar to CRISP-DM but are framed slightly differently: - Data selection – From large databases, choose relevant subsets. - Preprocessing – Clean and prepare the data. - Transformation – Reduce dimensions, select features, normalize variables. - Data mining – Apply algorithms to extract patterns. - Interpretation and evaluation – Translate patterns into useful knowledge.\nSo while CRISP-DM is popular in business practice, KDD is the more theoretical backbone you would often see in academic papers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy do you think industry and academia developed slightly different process models for the same overall idea?",

    "section": "1.5 How can data mining be used?",
    "text": "1.5 How can data mining be used?\nLet’s look at the typical tasks of data mining.\nHere’s a sample dataset—things like refund status, marital status, income, and whether someone cheats on taxes. From a dataset like this, what kinds of tasks might we perform?\n\nPredictive modeling: Can we predict whether someone is likely to cheat, given their attributes?\nClustering: Can we group taxpayers into categories—like high risk, medium risk, low risk—without labels?\nAnomaly detection: Can we find cases that look suspiciously different from the rest?\nAssociation rules: Can we uncover relationships—for example, divorced individuals with high income are more or less likely to cheat?\n\nEach of these tasks aligns with a type of real-world decision problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n‘Looking at this small tax dataset, what question would you want to ask first? Prediction, clustering, or anomaly detection?’”\n\n\n\n1.5.1 Predictive Modeling\n“redictive modeling is one of the most powerful applications of data mining. The idea is simple: we use training data—examples where the outcomes are known—to build a model that captures the relationship between inputs (features) and outputs (labels). Then, we apply that model to new, unseen data to predict outcomes.\nThis applies across many domains: - In finance: predicting loan defaults. - In marketing: predicting customer churn. - In healthcare: predicting disease risk.\nWe’ll focus on two main branches:\n\nClassification – when outcomes are categorical.\nRegression – when outcomes are numerical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCan you think of a business scenario where we would want to predict a number, and another where we’d want to predict a category?\n\n\n\n1.5.1.1 Predictive Modeling: Classification\nClassification is about predicting non-numerical categorical labels.\nExample: Think about a bank monitoring transactions. Classification models flag suspicious transactions as ‘fraud’ or ‘not fraud.’\nThere are many methods: decision trees, naïve Bayes, support vector machines, neural networks, logistic regression, and rule-based approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n‘How many of you have had a credit card transaction declined because the bank thought it was suspicious? That’s classification in action—sometimes right, sometimes wrong!’”\n\n\n\n\n1.5.1.2 Predictive Modeling: Regression\nRegression is similar to classification, but here the outcome is numerical. We use regression when we want to predict values like:\n\nFuture sales for a product.\nThe price of a house.\nThe index of a stock market.\n\nExample: A real estate company might use regression to predict house prices based on features like square footage, neighborhood, and number of bedrooms.\nMethods include multiple linear regression, Poisson regression, kernel regression, and support vector regression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n‘If Amazon wants to predict how many units of a new product will sell next month, is that classification or regression?’”\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Clustering\nClustering is about grouping data points into clusters without prior labels. Unlike predictive models where labels are predefined and given for training, clustering discovers categories automatically. Applications include:\n\nMarket segmentation: Grouping customers by behavior or preferences.\nDocument clustering: Grouping related news articles.\nStock market analysis: Grouping stocks with similar trends.\nSummarization: Reducing large datasets into manageable categories.\n\nMethods include k-means, hierarchical clustering, and density-based clustering.\nExample: A retailer could use clustering to identify customer segments—like bargain hunters, premium buyers, or occasional shoppers—without knowing those groups beforehand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThink about Spotify or Apple Music. How do you think clustering helps them group songs or users?\n\n\n\n\n1.5.3 Anomaly Detection\nAnomaly detection is about identifying outliers—cases that deviate significantly from normal patterns. This is incredibly important in practice: - Fraud detection: spotting unusual credit card transactions. - Cybersecurity: detecting intrusions or abnormal network activity. - Healthcare: identifying abnormal patient vitals that signal a problem.\nMethods include statistical tests, clustering-based detection (points far from any cluster), and machine learning methods like one-class support vector machines and neural networks.\nExample: If a customer normally spends $50–$100 per purchase, but suddenly makes a $10,000 purchase in another country, that’s flagged as an anomaly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n‘If your Netflix account suddenly started watching cartoons all night long—would that be an anomaly worth investigating?’”\n\n\n\n\n1.5.4 Association Rule Analysis\nAssociation rule analysis is about discovering dependencies between items.\nThe classic example is market-basket analysis: - Rule: {Diapers, Milk} → {Beer}. - This means customers who buy diapers and milk are likely to also buy beer.\nMethods include Apriori algorithm and pattern discovery approaches. Applications extend beyond retail: Telecom: Diagnosing alarms based on combinations of error codes.; Healthcare: Identifying co-occurrence of symptoms or treatments.; E-commerce: Powering recommendation engines (‘People who bought this also bought…’).\nExample: On Amazon, when you see ‘Frequently Bought Together,’ that’s association rule mining in action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n‘Think about your own online shopping. Has an item ever been recommended to you that felt spot-on? That’s association rules at work.’”",

For example,\n\nAnalysts in various fields: Business analysts, data analysts, and market researchers use mining to guide decisions.\nScientists and engineers: They apply it in areas like bioinformatics, astronomy, materials science, and engineering simulations.\nBusinesses: Companies mine customer data to personalize services, detect fraud, and optimize operations.\nGovernments: For public policy, fraud detection, and even security monitoring.\nComputers and AI systems: Increasingly, automated pipelines powered by machine learning algorithms mine data in real time—think recommendation systems or self-driving cars.\n\nIn practice, much of this happens behind the scenes, through automation. For example, Google’s search engine mines billions of webpages continuously, and Netflix constantly mines viewing data to refine recommendations.\nAnd let’s not forget—you! As students in this class, you’re training to become the next generation of professionals who will design, interpret, and apply these data mining techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n‘Quick brainstorm: Can you name one profession or industry that you think will rely even more on data mining in the next 5–10 years?’”",

    "text": "2.2 Preliminaries\n\n2.2.1 Why Python?\nIn business analytics, learning a programming language is extremely valuable (often essential) since many tasks are more efficiently done with computer and code. Once you become familiar with a programming language and its core concepts (like variables, loops, data structures), learning other languages often becomes easier, though each has its own syntax and paradigm-specific features.\nOnce you become familiar with a language, learning other languages (including ones, like R or C++, specialized to specific tasks) becomes much easier, where most of the programming concepts similarly apply across most languages.\n\n\n\nZDNet’s programming language popularity index as of 2024 (Image source link).\n\n\nHere, Python is one of the most popular programming languages nowadays.\nIt’s one of the easiest to learn. Its simplicity and readability make it a common first language for students, while its deep ecosystem of libraries makes it suitable for advanced tasks.\nAlso, Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it’s highly versatile as it can handle tasks ranging from basic calculations to advanced machine learning (e.g., large language models in ChatGPT) in diverse domains, including data science, web development, automation, engineering, etc., and accordingly across the industry, academia, and the public sector.\nThis combination is why people often say Python has a “low floor and high ceiling.”\nBesides, Python also shines in cloud computing environments, thanks to strong support from cloud providers and its rich ecosystem of open-source packages.\nIn summary, Python is an outstanding language for analytics, data science, and various applications in business. It’s no surprise that it consistently ranks among the most popular programming languages in the world!\n\n\n2.2.2 Related Concepts\nBefore diving into coding, it’s important to understand a computational environment as the setup that allows you to write and run Python code. In this section, let’s briefly understand the key elements of a computational environment for coding.\nA computational environment typically includes elements that together define where and how your code will run:\n\nThe operating system you’re working on (e.g., macOS Catalina)\nThe version of the programming language (e.g., Python 3.11)\nInstalled packages or libraries (e.g., pandas 2.1.0)\n\nTo set up a working Python environment, you’ll need:\n\nA computer with an operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux, or a cloud-based platform)\nAn installation of Python, the programming language that enables the computer to interpret and execute the code\nVarious packages that extend Python’s capabilities for various tasks\nAnd, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that is a tool to write and execute code (in a convient way)\n\nLet’s walk through each of these in more detail.\n\n2.2.2.1 Operating System\nAn operating system (OS) is the core software that manages everything on your computer. It acts like a middleman between your hardware (like CPU, memory, keyboard, etc.) and the applications you use (like a web browser or software). In the context of a Python environment, the OS is the foundation that everything else runs on. It affects how Python is installed, how packages behave, and even how your code interacts with files, memory, and other system resources. To be specific, the OS does the following for Python:\n\nRuns the Python interpreter: The OS loads and executes the Python program when you run a script.\nHandles file paths and directories: Python uses OS-specific paths (e.g., C:\\folder\\file.txt on Windows and /home/user/file.txt on Linux).\nManages packages and dependencies: Some Python packages have OS-specific versions or behaviors.\nSupports external tools: Tools like compilers or system libraries that Python may depend on are managed by the OS.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.2 Python interpreter\nA Python interpreter is the program that reads and runs your Python code.\nWhen you write code in Python—like print(\"Hello\"), you’re writing instructions in a human-readable way. But your computer doesn’t understand Python directly. That’s where the interpreter comes in.\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/internal-working-of-python/\nYou write a Python code, and run it. Then, a Python interpreter processes and runs the instructions in your code. To execute Python code, a computer needs , which\nPython is both a programming language that humans can read, and a language that computers can read, interpret, and then carry out instructions based on. For a computer to be able to read and execute Python code, it needs to have a Python interpreter installed. There are lots of ways to install a Python “interpreter” on your own computer, this book recommends the uv distribution of Python for its flexibility, simplicity, and features. Cloud services often come with a Python interpreter installed, and we’ll see shortly how to install one on your own computer.\nIn the box below, you can see which version of Python was used to compile this book:\n\nimport sys\nprint(\"Compiled with Python version:\", sys.version)\n\nCompiled with Python version: 3.11.13 | packaged by Anaconda, Inc. | (main, Jun  5 2025, 13:03:15) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)]\n\n\nThink of it like a translator:\n\nYou (the programmer) write instructions in Python.\nThe interpreter translates those instructions into something the computer can understand and act on.\nThe computer then follows those instructions to do things—like print messages, do math, or analyze data.\nThere are different types of Python interpreters, like:\n\nCPython (the standard and most common one),\nPyPy (faster in some cases),\nor ones that run inside other environments (like Jupyter Notebooks or cloud platforms).\n\n\nWhen you install Python on your computer, you’re actually installing the interpreter along with tools to help you write and run Python programs. Without the interpreter, Python code is just text—the computer wouldn’t know what to do with it.\n\n\n2.2.2.3 Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\nAn integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps you write, test, and debug your code more easily.\nThe most important of these is a way to write the code itself! IDEs are not the only way to programme, but they are perhaps the most useful.\nIf you have used Stata or Matlab, you may not have realised it, but these analytical tools bundle the interpreter and the IDE together. But they are separate things: the interpreter is a way of processing your instructions, the IDE is where you write those instructions.\nThere are a lot of integrated development environments (IDEs) out there, including PyCharm, IDLE, Visual Studio Code. In this course, Jupyter will be used as it works on all major operating systems and is one of the most popular.\nImagine you’re writing a story—an IDE is like a smart writing tool that not only lets you type but also checks your spelling, suggests words, helps you organize chapters, and even lets you publish the book when you’re done. For coding, an IDE does something similar.\nHere’s what an IDE typically includes:\n\nCode editor: where you type your code (like a fancy text editor).\nSyntax highlighting: colors and styles that make your code easier to read.\nAutocomplete: suggests code as you type, helping you write faster and with fewer errors.\nDebugger: lets you pause and inspect your code when something goes wrong.\nTerminal or console: to run your code and see results directly.\n\nSome popular Python IDEs are:\n\nJupyter Notebook: great for data analysis and visualization.\nPyCharm: powerful and feature-rich, good for large projects.\nVisual Studio Code: lightweight, customizable, and widely used.\nIDLE: a simple IDE that comes with Python by default.\n\nIn short, an IDE makes coding more convenient and productive by bringing all the tools you need into one place.\n\n\n2.2.2.4 Python Packages\nA Python package (also called library) is a collection of tools (typically for one-themed topic/goal) such as functions, classes, data, and documentation that help you do specific tasks more easily, without having to write everything from scratch, like a toolbox that has ready-made tools for specific jobs.\nYou may prepare a toolbox and take it out on your workbench when the tools are needed. Similarly, you will install a package and add the package to the setup in your code. By doing so, they give you useful tools that others have already written and tested, so you can focus on solving your problem instead of reinventing the wheel. Eventually, saving your time and effort, you can easily extend the capabilities of an installed basic Python on your computer.\nYou can use Python with extra packages for various tasks such as doing math, analyzing data, making graphs, building websites, or training machine learning models. For example, the math package has functions like math.sqrt() to calculate square roots; the pandas package helps you work with tables of data (like spreadsheets); the matplotlib package is used to make plots and charts; the scikit-learn package offers tools for machine learning.\n\n\n\n2.2.2.5 Typical workflow\nThe typical workflow for analysis with code might be something like this:\n\nOpen up your integrated development environment (IDE)\nWrite some code in a script (a text file with code in) in your IDE\nIf necessary for the analysis that you’re doing, install any extra packages\nUse the IDE to send bits of code from the script, or the entire script, to be executed by Python and add-on packages, and to display results\n(once the project is complete) ensure the script can be run from top to bottom to re-produce your analysis\n\nWe’ll see two ways to achieve this workflow:\n\nInstalling an IDE, a Python interpreter, and any extra Python packages on your own computer\nUsing a computer in the cloud that you access through your internet browser. Cloud computers often have an IDE and Python built-in, and you can easily install extra packages in them too. However, you should be aware that the cloud service we recommend has a 60 hours / month free tier. Beyond this you’ll need to pay for extra hours.\n\nYou should pick whichever you’re more comfortable with! Eventually, you’ll probably try both.",

    "section": "2.3 Setting Your Own Computer",
    "text": "2.3 Setting Your Own Computer\nThe following instruction is for a python environment on your own computer. The overall installation is as follow:\n\nInstall Anaconda/Conda as a platform for virtual environments\nInstall Python in a virtual environment\nInstall Jupyter Notebook as an IDE in the virtual environment\n\n\n2.3.1 Installing Anaconda (or Conda)\n\n2.3.1.1 Virtual Environment\nDifferent projects often require different environment setups. That’s when a virtual environment comes in handy, which helps to work on isolated Python environments where you can freely create/delete them (with no risk of messing up your entire computer).\nAlso, considering rapid version updates, an easy way to manage a python environment for the compatibility of python and many packages is building it on a virtual environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Use Conda to Install Python?\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Python through Conda (via Anaconda or Miniconda) is highly recommended for this course, especially for users working with data science and analytics tools.\nHere’s why:\n\nIsolated Environments: Conda allows you to create separate environments for different projects. Each environment can have its own version of Python and packages—preventing version conflicts.\nBetter Package Management: Unlike pip (Python’s default package manager), Conda can install not just Python packages but also system-level dependencies like C or Fortran libraries. This is especially helpful for scientific packages like numpy, scipy, and pytorch.\nCross-Platform Compatibility: Conda works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is also used by most cloud data science environments, helping ensure reproducibility.\nFast Setup with Anaconda: The Anaconda distribution includes over 250 pre-installed data science packages (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, jupyterlab), making it ideal for beginners and fast onboarding.\nScientific Computing Support: Many data science and machine learning tools depend on optimized compiled libraries. Conda handles these dependencies more reliably than pip.\nReproducible, portable environments that “just work,” especially in data science: Conda is the most robust choice.\n\n\n\nAnaconda is a popular software for that.\nhttps://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/getting-started\nhttps://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Installing Python in Virtual Environment through Conda\nhttps://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html\nTo install Python, we’re going to use the command-line interface (CLI), because it’s simple to lightly handle environments, packages, and version control via the terminal.\nKnowing a little bit about it is really useful for coding (and more)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Terminal in Brief\n\n\n\nThe command-line interface (also known as the command-line  and sometimes the command prompt) is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with the system (software) via command, each of which is formatted as a line of text, to your computer. In there, a command interpreter (also known as a command-line interpreter, command processor, or shell) is a program that implements a user’s commands via a CLI, acting like a bridge between the user and the operating system’s internal functions.\nMost OS’s (Linux, Mac, and Windows) have a built-in command-line program:\n\nthe PowerShell on Windows.\n\nSearch PowerShell and open it (without activating a conda environment which will be discussed below).\nOr, install PowerShell Prompt in Anaconda and run it in the virtual environment (activating it).\n\nthe Terminal on macOS\n\nSearch “Terminal” and open it\nTerminal User Guide\n\nthe Terminal on Linux\n\nSearch “Terminal” (the default Bash and open it\nThe Linux command line for beginners\nUsingTheTerminal - Ubuntu documantation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2.1 Installing Python in Conda Environments\nfollowing command in the terminal, and hit y to proceed\nconda create --name env_buda450 python=3.11\nIn the command, you can replace env_buda450 with the name you want for the environment. By including programs/packages (and its versions) in the command, you can install them together when the environment is created (e.g., python version 3.11).\nCheck more details from Creating an environment with commands.\nThen, let’s activate the created environment env_buda450 by hitting in your terminal.\nconda activate env_buda450\nthen, install python. For a specific version of python (e.g., python 3.13),\nconda install python=3.13\n\n\n2.3.2.2 Installing Python Packages\nPython packages are typically not written by the core developers/maintainers of the Python language, but by anyone, enthusiasts, firms, researchers, academics, and you where anyone can make one, and so they don’t come built-in (by definition) in the Python. Therefore, you need to additionally install them and then import them into your scripts when you use them in a script.\nWithin the Python environment (e.g., after activating your conda environment), you can install a package by executing a commend in your computer terminal.\nFor example, let’s install the numpy package, which provides comprehensive numerical, mathematical operations as a basis of many advanced data science packages, by entering the following commend into the command line in your terminal.\nconda install numpy\nWhen you hit yes y (after the install command), it will automatically download the package (and its required dependent packages) from the internet and install in the appropriate place on your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn this course, we will use conda to install packages because it’s relatively more generic and convenient for tasks dealing with environments and complex dependencies, compared with pip. See the explanation in link for more details.\n\n\nSimilarly, let’s install two other Python packages: pandas for data analysis and manipulation and matplotlib for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. To install them together, the packages can be listed with commas:\nconda install pandas, matplotlib\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nSometimes, the name of a package for installation may differ from its full name or for import.\nFor example, scikit-learn is a package for data mining and machine learning tasks. To install it, we use the name scikit-learn:\nconda install scikit-learn\nHowever, the package is called sklearn.\n\nimport sklearn\nprint(sklearn.__version__)\n\n1.6.1\n\n\nSo, it’s recommended to always check the exact instruction from the original website (e.g., pandas and matplotlib).\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Installing Jupyter Notebook\n\n2.3.3.1 Other IDEs\nVisual Studio Code is a free and open source IDE from Microsoft that is available on all major operating systems. Just like Python itself, Visual Studio can be extended with packages, and it is those packages, called extensions in this case, that make it so useful. As well as Python, Visual Studio Code supports a ton of other languages.\nThese instructions are for if you wish to code in the cloud rather than on your own computer. There are many ways to do data science in the cloud, but we’re going to share with you the absolute simplest.\nYou can run the code online through a few other options. The first is the easiest to get started with.\n\nGithub Codespaces. Github owned by Microsoft provides a range of services, including a way to back-up code on the cloud, and cloud computing. Github Codespaces is an online cloud computer that you connect to from your browser window. For this, you will need to sign up for a Github Account.\nGoogle Colab notebooks. Free for most use. You can launch most pages in this book interactively by using the ‘Colab’ button under the rocket symbol at the top of most pages in this book. It will be in the form of a notebook (which mixes code and text) rather than a script (.py file) but the code you write is the same. Note that Colab doesn’t use Visual Studio Code.",

    "text": "2.2 Preliminaries\n\n2.2.1 Why Python?\nIn business analytics, learning a programming language is extremely valuable (often essential) since many tasks are more efficiently done with computer and code. Once you become familiar with a programming language and its core concepts (like variables, loops, data structures), learning other languages often becomes easier, though each has its own syntax and paradigm-specific features.\nOnce you become familiar with a language, learning other languages (including ones, like R or C++, specialized to specific tasks) becomes much easier, where most of the programming concepts similarly apply across most languages.\n\n\n\nZDNet’s programming language popularity index as of 2024 (Image source link).\n\n\nHere, Python is one of the most popular programming languages nowadays.\nIt’s one of the easiest to learn. Its simplicity and readability make it a common first language for students, while its deep ecosystem of libraries makes it suitable for advanced tasks.\nAlso, Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it’s highly versatile as it can handle tasks ranging from basic calculations to advanced machine learning (e.g., large language models in ChatGPT) in diverse domains, including data science, web development, automation, engineering, etc., and accordingly across the industry, academia, and the public sector.\nThis combination is why people often say Python has a “low floor and high ceiling.”\nBesides, Python also shines in cloud computing environments, thanks to strong support from cloud providers and its rich ecosystem of open-source packages.\nIn summary, Python is an outstanding language for analytics, data science, and various applications in business. It’s no surprise that it consistently ranks among the most popular programming languages in the world!\n\n\n2.2.2 Related Concepts\nBefore diving into coding, it’s important to understand a computational environment as the setup that allows you to write and run Python code. In this section, let’s briefly understand the key elements of a computational environment for coding.\nA computational environment typically includes elements that together define where and how your code will run:\n\nThe operating system you’re working on (e.g., macOS)\nThe version of the programming language (e.g., Python 3.11)\nInstalled packages or libraries (e.g., pandas 2.1.0)\n\nTo set up a working Python environment, you’ll need:\n\nA computer with an operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux, or a cloud-based platform)\nAn installation of Python, the programming language that enables the computer to interpret and execute the code\nVarious packages that extend Python’s capabilities for various tasks\nAnd, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that is a tool to write and execute code (in a convient way)\n\nLet’s walk through each of these in more detail.\n\n2.2.2.1 Operating System\nAn operating system (OS) is the core software that manages everything on your computer. It acts like a middleman between your hardware (like CPU, memory, keyboard, etc.) and the applications you use (like a web browser or software). In the context of a Python environment, the OS is the foundation that everything else runs on. It affects how Python is installed, how packages behave, and even how your code interacts with files, memory, and other system resources. To be specific, the OS does the following for Python:\n\nRuns the Python interpreter: The OS loads and executes the Python program when you run a script.\nHandles file paths and directories: Python uses OS-specific paths (e.g., C:\\folder\\file.txt on Windows and /home/user/file.txt on Linux).\nManages packages and dependencies: Some Python packages have OS-specific versions or behaviors.\nSupports external tools: Tools like compilers or system libraries that Python may depend on are managed by the OS.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.2 Python interpreter\nA Python interpreter is the program that reads and runs your Python code.\nWhen you write code in Python—like print(\"Hello\"), you’re writing instructions in a human-readable way.

Therefore, you need to additionally install them and then import them into your scripts when you use them in a script.\nWithin the Python environment (e.g., after activating your conda environment), you can install a package by executing a commend in your computer terminal.\nFor example, let’s install the numpy package, which provides comprehensive numerical, mathematical operations as a basis of many advanced data science packages, by entering the following commend into the command line in your terminal.\nconda install numpy\nWhen you hit yes y (after the install command), it will automatically download the package (and its required dependent packages) from the internet and install in the appropriate place on your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn this course, we will use conda to install packages because it’s relatively more generic and convenient for tasks dealing with environments and complex dependencies, compared with pip. See the explanation in link for more details.\n\n\nSimilarly, let’s install two other Python packages: pandas for data analysis and manipulation and matplotlib for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. To install them together, the packages can be listed with commas:\nconda install pandas, matplotlib\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nSometimes, the name of a package for installation may differ from its full name or for import.\nFor example, scikit-learn is a package for data mining and machine learning tasks. To install it, we use the name scikit-learn:\nconda install scikit-learn\nHowever, the package is called sklearn.\n\nimport sklearn\nprint(sklearn.__version__)\n\n1.6.1\n\n\nSo, it’s recommended to always check the exact instruction from the original website (e.g., pandas and matplotlib).\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Installing JupyterLab (and Notebook)\n\n2.3.3.1 Other IDEs\nVisual Studio Code is a free and open source IDE from Microsoft that is available on all major operating systems. Just like Python itself, Visual Studio can be extended with packages, and it is those packages, called extensions in this case, that make it so useful. As well as Python, Visual Studio Code supports a ton of other languages.\nThese instructions are for if you wish to code in the cloud rather than on your own computer. There are many ways to do data science in the cloud, but we’re going to share with you the absolute simplest.\nYou can run the code online through a few other options. The first is the easiest to get started with.\n\nGithub Codespaces. Github owned by Microsoft provides a range of services, including a way to back-up code on the cloud, and cloud computing. Github Codespaces is an online cloud computer that you connect to from your browser window. For this, you will need to sign up for a Github Account.\nGoogle Colab notebooks. Free for most use. You can launch most pages in this book interactively by using the ‘Colab’ button under the rocket symbol at the top of most pages in this book. It will be in the form of a notebook (which mixes code and text) rather than a script (.py file) but the code you write is the same. Note that Colab doesn’t use Visual Studio Code.",

    "section": "2.2 Python",
    "text": "2.2 Python\nIn business analytics, learning a programming language is valuable (often essential) since many tasks are more efficiently done with computer and code. Once you become familiar with a programming language and its core concepts (like variables, loops, data structures), learning other languages often becomes easier, though each has its own syntax and paradigm-specific features. Once you become familiar with a language, learning other languages (including ones, like R or C++, specialized to specific tasks) becomes much easier, where most of the programming concepts similarly apply across most languages.\n\n2.2.1 What is Python?\nPython is a high-level, interpreted programming language created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.\n\nBeing high-level means it abstracts away many of the low-level details of computer operation, such as memory management, so that programmers can focus on problem-solving rather than machine instructions.\nIt is also an interpreted language, which means Python code does not need to be compiled before execution. Instead, the Python interpreter reads and executes the code line by line, making it highly flexible for testing and development.\nA key feature of Python is its emphasis on simplicity and readability. Its syntax is designed to resemble plain English, which makes programs easier to write, understand, and maintain. This characteristic has made Python a very accessible language for beginners, while still powerful enough for advanced applications.\nPython is also cross-platform. It runs consistently on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and it integrates well with other languages such as C, C++, and Java. This versatility has contributed significantly to its widespread adoption.\nFinally, Python is open-source and supported by a global community. Anyone can contribute to its development, expand its libraries, and share tools. As a result, Python has evolved into one of the most widely used and versatile programming languages today.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Why Python?\nPython has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, especially for data science, machine learning, and business analytics.\n\n\n\nZDNet’s programming language popularity index as of 2024 (Image source link).\n\n\nThe reasons include:\n\nPython has an extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. These libraries are ready-made toolkits that extend Python’s core capabilities. For example, pandas allows efficient handling of tabular data, numpy provides fast numerical computations, matplotlib and seaborn enable data visualization, and scikit-learn supports machine learning. This broad set of tools makes Python highly adaptable to tasks in business analytics, data mining, and visualization.\nPython offers high productivity. Its simple and readable syntax allows users to express ideas in fewer lines of code compared to many other programming languages. This reduces development time and makes it easier to test and debug. The interpreted nature of Python also enables interactive development, where code can be tested incrementally without needing to compile full programs.\nPython benefits from a strong and active global community. Because it is open-source, the language is constantly improved and expanded. Documentation, tutorials, and Q&A forums are widely available, meaning that support is easily accessible. This strong community ensures that Python stays relevant and up to date with evolving technologies.\n\nIn summary, Python is popular because it combines power and flexibility with accessibility. These qualities make it an excellent language for exploring data, performing analysis, and creating clear, visual insights.\n\n\n2.2.3 Where to Use Python?\nPython is a general-purpose programming language, which means it can be applied across a wide variety of domains. Some common uses1 include:\n\nWeb development: Creating websites and web applications using frameworks such as Django and Flask.\nData analysis and visualization: Working with structured and unstructured data, cleaning it, analyzing patterns, and presenting results visually with libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence: Building predictive models, natural language processing systems, and intelligent applications with libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.\nScientific computing: Performing simulations, optimization, and large-scale computations in research and engineering.\nAutomation and scripting: Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks, system processes, or business workflows.\nDesktop and GUI applications: Developing standalone tools or user-friendly applications with interfaces.\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Online Materials for Python\nThere are many resources available online for learning and troubleshooting Python. - The Python Documentation is one of the great sources for the information, which includes explanations, examples, and reference material for every part of the language. - The Python Wiki provides curated information including Beginner’s Guide separately for non-programmers and those with prior programming experience. - Beyond that, platforms such as Stack Overflow, Real Python, Geeks for Geeks, and various tutorials offer practical examples and solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTutorials and beginner guides\n\n\n\nFrom the Python Software Foundation and Python Wiki.\n\nFor nonprogrammer\nFor programmer (know other programming languages)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5 Python Versions\nPython exists in two major versions2 — Python 2 and Python 3.\n\nPython 2 was widely used for many years but reached its official end-of-life in January 2020. This means it no longer receives updates, bug fixes, or security patches. Some legacy codebases may still use Python 2, but it is no longer recommended for new development.\nPython 3 is the current and actively maintained version of the language. All modern libraries and tools are built for Python 3, and this is the version we will use throughout this course. Specifically, we will rely on Python 3.11, which is stable, well-supported, and compatible with the libraries we need for data mining and visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen you encounter tutorials or examples online, you may still see some written for Python 2. The syntax and behavior can differ in subtle but important ways, so always confirm that the code is written for the version you are using.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.6 Python Environment\nBefore diving into coding, it’s important to understand a Python (development) environment3 as the setup that allows you to write and run Python code. Often, you cannot even use Python without a proper development environment.\nThere are a number of ways to build development environments for python with various programs. At this time, let’s learn one way for building a properly configured environment to ensure that your code runs consistently, both on your machine and on others’.\nA Python environment typically includes core components that together define where and how your code will run:\n\nOperating system (OS) you’re working on (e.g., macOS) with a computer\nProgramming language (e.g., Python 3.11) that enables the computer to interpret and execute the code\nPackages that extend Python’s capabilities for various tasks\n\nTo set up a efficient Python environment, you can additionally consider:\n\nAn Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that is a tool to write and execute code (in a convenient way)\nVirtual environments that enables the development separately by project in isolated setups",

    "text": "2.3 Setting Python Development Environment (Local)\nThe following instruction is for a python environment on your own computer. The overall installation is as follow:\n\nInstall Anaconda/Conda as a platform for virtual environments\nInstall Python in a virtual environment\nInstall Jupyter Notebook as an IDE in the virtual environment\n\n\n2.3.1 Installing Anaconda (and Conda)\nDifferent projects often require different environment setups. That’s when a virtual environment comes in handy, which helps to work on isolated Python environments where you can freely create/delete them (with no risk of messing up your entire computer).\n\n2.3.1.1 Virtual Environment\nA virtual environment allows you to create a self-contained workspace where Python and all required libraries are stored separately from the system-wide installation.\nAnaconda/Conda is a popular software to manage virtual environments. To manage Python environments, we will use Anaconda/Conda.\n\nConda\n\nA package as the environment manager that creates isolated environments and installs packages (Python, R, C/Fortran libs, CUDA toolkits, etc.).\nWorks with any “distribution” (Anaconda, Miniconda, Miniforge).\n\nAnaconda\n\nA bundled distribution that includes conda, Python, Anaconda Navigator (GUI), and hundreds of prebuilt packages and Jupyter—all in one installer.\nBig install (~GBs), great for offline or “everything ready” setups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Use Conda to Install Python?\n\n\n\nInstalling Python through Conda (via Anaconda or Miniconda—minimal version of Anaconda) is highly recommended for this course, especially for users working with data science and analytics tools.\nHere’s why:\n\nIsolated Environments: Conda allows you to create separate environments for different projects. Each environment can have its own version of Python and packages—preventing version conflicts.\nBetter Package Management: Unlike pip (Python’s default package manager), Conda can install not just Python packages but also system-level dependencies like C or Fortran libraries. This is especially helpful for scientific packages like numpy, scipy, and pytorch.\nCross-Platform Compatibility: Conda works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is also used by most cloud data science environments, helping ensure reproducibility.\nFast Setup with Anaconda: The Anaconda distribution includes over 250 pre-installed data science packages (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, jupyterlab), making it ideal for beginners and fast onboarding.\nScientific Computing Support: Many data science and machine learning tools depend on optimized compiled libraries. Conda handles these dependencies more reliably than pip.\nReproducible, portable environments that “just work,” especially in data science: Conda is the most robust choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Installing Python in Virtual Environment through Conda\nTo install Python, we’re going to use the command-line interface (CLI), because it’s simple to lightly handle environments, packages, and version control via the terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Terminal in Brief\n\n\n\nThe command-line interface (also known as the command-line  and sometimes the command prompt) is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with the system (software) via command, each of which is formatted as a line of text, to your computer. In there, a command interpreter (also known as a command-line interpreter, command processor, or shell) is a program that implements a user’s commands via a CLI, acting like a bridge between the user and the operating system’s internal functions.\nMost OS’s (Linux, Mac, and Windows) have a built-in command-line program:\n\nthe PowerShell on Windows.\n\nSearch PowerShell and open it (without activating a conda environment which will be discussed below).\nOr, install PowerShell Prompt in Anaconda and run it in the virtual environment (activating it).\n\nthe Terminal on macOS\n\nSearch “Terminal” and open it\nTerminal User Guide\n\nthe Terminal on Linux\n\nSearch “Terminal” (the default Bash and open it\nThe Linux command line for beginners\nUsingTheTerminal - Ubuntu documantation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2.1 Installing Anaconda\nInstalling Anaconda Distribution is the official website for the installation, in which the step-by-step procedure is documented well.\n\n\n2.3.2.2 Creating a Virtual Environment\nOnce you open the installed Anaconda on your computer, you start the Anaconda GUI on the base environment where your OS directly interact and that it is recommended not to use for projects. Instead of working on the base, let’s create a new one.\nTo do that, let’s open a terminal\n\nIn Windows, any prompt on the Anaconda GUI (e.g., Powershell Prompt, CMD.exe Prompt, or anaconda_prompt) — Not directly from Windows\nIn macOS/Linux, the OS’s terminal\n\nIn the terminal’s prompt, you should have (base) that indicates the current environment.\nA new environment with a name buda450_py311 can be created with the following command:\nconda create --name buda450_py311\nIn the command, you can replace buda450_py311 with the name you want for the environment. After completing the creation, the environment can be activated with the following command:\nconda activate buda450_py311\nCheck more details from Managing environments and about other Commands .\n\n\n2.3.2.3 Installing Python and Programs/Packages\nThen, Python can be installed through the following command.\nconda install python=3.11\nHere, Python’s version is specified (i.e., python 3.11). Without the version specification like conda install python, Python will be installed based on the conda’s default version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating an environment with python installation\n\n\n\nBy including programs/packages (and its versions) in the command, you can install them together when the environment is created.\nconda create --name buda450_py311 python=3.11\n\n\nSimilarly, some programs useful for Python can be installed in Conda environments.\nThe following command installs Jupyter’s Notebook and JupyterLab together.\nconda install notebook jupyterlab\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn this course, we will use conda to install packages because it’s relatively more generic and convenient for tasks dealing with environments and complex dependencies, compared with pip. See the explanation in link for more details.\n\n\nSimilarly, you can install packages by executing a commend. For example, let’s install three pacakges\n\nnumpy for comprehensive numerical, mathematical operations as a basis of many advanced data science packages, by entering the following commend into the command line in your terminal.\npandas for data analysis and manipulation\nmatplotlib for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.\n\nconda install numpy pandas matplotlib\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nSometimes, the name of a package for installation may differ from its full name or for import.\nFor example, scikit-learn is a package for data mining and machine learning tasks. To install it, we use the name scikit-learn:\nconda install scikit-learn\nHowever, the package is called sklearn.\n\nimport sklearn\nprint(sklearn.__version__)\n\n1.6.1\n\n\nSo, it’s recommended to always check the exact commands from the original website (e.g., pandas) and repositories (e.g., anaconda’s Python Package Index (PyPi)).",

    "text": "2.2 Python\nIn business analytics, learning a programming language is valuable (often essential) since many tasks are more efficiently done with computer and code. Once you become familiar with a programming language and its core concepts (like variables, loops, data structures), learning other languages often becomes easier, though each has its own syntax and paradigm-specific features. Once you become familiar with a language, learning other languages (including ones, like R or C++, specialized to specific tasks) becomes much easier, where most of the programming concepts similarly apply across most languages.\n\n2.2.1 What is Python?\nPython is a high-level, interpreted programming language created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.\n\nBeing high-level means it abstracts away many of the low-level details of computer operation, such as memory management, so that programmers can focus on problem-solving rather than machine instructions.\nIt is also an interpreted language, which means Python code does not need to be compiled before execution. Instead, the Python interpreter reads and executes the code line by line, making it highly flexible for testing and development.\nA key feature of Python is its emphasis on simplicity and readability. Its syntax is designed to resemble plain English, which makes programs easier to write, understand, and maintain. This characteristic has made Python a very accessible language for beginners, while still powerful enough for advanced applications.\nPython is also cross-platform. It runs consistently on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and it integrates well with other languages such as C, C++, and Java. This versatility has contributed significantly to its widespread adoption.\nFinally, Python is open-source and supported by a global community. Anyone can contribute to its development, expand its libraries, and share tools. As a result, Python has evolved into one of the most widely used and versatile programming languages today.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Why Python?\nPython has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, especially for data science, machine learning, and business analytics.\n\n\n\nZDNet’s programming language popularity index as of 2024 (Image source link).\n\n\nThe reasons include:\n\nPython has an extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. These libraries are ready-made toolkits that extend Python’s core capabilities. For example, pandas allows efficient handling of tabular data, numpy provides fast numerical computations, matplotlib and seaborn enable data visualization, and scikit-learn supports machine learning. This broad set of tools makes Python highly adaptable to tasks in business analytics, data mining, and visualization.\nPython offers high productivity. Its simple and readable syntax allows users to express ideas in fewer lines of code compared to many other programming languages. This reduces development time and makes it easier to test and debug. The interpreted nature of Python also enables interactive development, where code can be tested incrementally without needing to compile full programs.\nPython benefits from a strong and active global community. Because it is open-source, the language is constantly improved and expanded. Documentation, tutorials, and Q&A forums are widely available, meaning that support is easily accessible. This strong community ensures that Python stays relevant and up to date with evolving technologies.\n\nIn summary, Python is popular because it combines power and flexibility with accessibility. These qualities make it an excellent language for exploring data, performing analysis, and creating clear, visual insights.\n\n\n2.2.3 Where to Use Python?\nPython is a general-purpose programming language, which means it can be applied across a wide variety of domains. Some common uses1 include:\n\nWeb development: Creating websites and web applications using frameworks such as Django and Flask.\nData analysis and visualization: Working with structured and unstructured data, cleaning it, analyzing patterns, and presenting results visually with libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence: Building predictive models, natural language processing systems, and intelligent applications with libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.\nScientific computing: Performing simulations, optimization, and large-scale computations in research and engineering.\nAutomation and scripting: Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks, system processes, or business workflows.\nDesktop and GUI applications: Developing standalone tools or user-friendly applications with interfaces.\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Online Materials for Python\nThere are many resources available online for learning and troubleshooting Python. - The Python Documentation is one of the great sources for the information, which includes explanations, examples, and reference material for every part of the language. - The Python Wiki provides curated information including Beginner’s Guide separately for non-programmers and those with prior programming experience. - Beyond that, platforms such as Stack Overflow, Real Python, Geeks for Geeks, and various tutorials offer practical examples and solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTutorials and beginner guides\n\n\n\nFrom the Python Software Foundation and Python Wiki.\n\nFor nonprogrammer\nFor programmer (know other programming languages)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5 Python Versions\nPython exists in two major versions2 — Python 2 and Python 3.\n\nPython 2 was widely used for many years but reached its official end-of-life in January 2020. This means it no longer receives updates, bug fixes, or security patches. Some legacy codebases may still use Python 2, but it is no longer recommended for new development.\nPython 3 is the current and actively maintained version of the language. All modern libraries and tools are built for Python 3, and this is the version we will use throughout this course. Specifically, we will rely on Python 3.11, which is stable, well-supported, and compatible with the libraries we need for data mining and visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen you encounter tutorials or examples online, you may still see some written for Python 2. The syntax and behavior can differ in subtle but important ways, so always confirm that the code is written for the version you are using.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.6 Python Environment\nBefore diving into coding, it’s important to understand a Python (development) environment3 as the setup that allows you to write and run Python code. Often, you cannot even use Python without a proper development environment.\nThere are a number of ways to build development environments for python with various programs. At this time, let’s learn one way for building a properly configured environment to ensure that your code runs consistently, both on your machine and on others’.\nA Python environment typically includes core components that together define where and how your code will run:\n\nOperating system (OS) you’re working on (e.g., macOS) with a computer\nProgramming language (e.g., Python 3.11) that enables the computer to interpret and execute the code\nPackages that extend Python’s capabilities for various tasks\n\nTo set up a efficient Python environment, you can additionally consider:\n\nAn Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that is a tool to write and execute code (in a convenient way)\nVirtual environments that enables the development separately by project in isolated setups",

    "text": "2.3 Setting Python Development Environment (Local)\nThe following instruction is for a python environment on your own computer. The overall installation is as follow:\n\nInstall Anaconda/Conda as a platform for virtual environments\nInstall Python in a virtual environment\nInstall Jupyter Notebook as an IDE in the virtual environment\n\n\n2.3.1 Installing Anaconda (and Conda)\nDifferent projects often require different environment setups. That’s when a virtual environment comes in handy, which helps to work on isolated Python environments where you can freely create/delete them (with no risk of messing up your entire computer).\n\n2.3.1.1 Virtual Environment\nA virtual environment allows you to create a self-contained workspace where Python and all required libraries are stored separately from the system-wide installation.\nAnaconda/Conda is a popular software to manage virtual environments. To manage Python environments, we will use Anaconda/Conda.\n\nConda\n\nA package as the environment manager that creates isolated environments and installs packages (Python, R, C/Fortran libs, CUDA toolkits, etc.).\nWorks with any “distribution” (Anaconda, Miniconda, Miniforge).\n\nAnaconda\n\nA bundled distribution that includes conda, Python, Anaconda Navigator (GUI), and hundreds of prebuilt packages and Jupyter—all in one installer.\nBig install (~GBs), great for offline or “everything ready” setups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Use Conda to Install Python?\n\n\n\nInstalling Python through Conda (via Anaconda or Miniconda—minimal version of Anaconda) is highly recommended for this course, especially for users working with data science and analytics tools.\nHere’s why:\n\nIsolated Environments: Conda allows you to create separate environments for different projects. Each environment can have its own version of Python and packages—preventing version conflicts.\nBetter Package Management: Unlike pip (Python’s default package manager), Conda can install not just Python packages but also system-level dependencies like C or Fortran libraries. This is especially helpful for scientific packages like numpy, scipy, and pytorch.\nCross-Platform Compatibility: Conda works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is also used by most cloud data science environments, helping ensure reproducibility.\nFast Setup with Anaconda: The Anaconda distribution includes over 250 pre-installed data science packages (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, jupyterlab), making it ideal for beginners and fast onboarding.\nScientific Computing Support: Many data science and machine learning tools depend on optimized compiled libraries. Conda handles these dependencies more reliably than pip.\nReproducible, portable environments that “just work,” especially in data science: Conda is the most robust choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Installing Python in Virtual Environment through Conda\nTo install Python, we’re going to use the command-line interface (CLI), because it’s simple to lightly handle environments, packages, and version control via the terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Terminal in Brief\n\n\n\nThe command-line interface (also known as the command-line  and sometimes the command prompt) is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with the system (software) via command, each of which is formatted as a line of text, to your computer. In there, a command interpreter (also known as a command-line interpreter, command processor, or shell) is a program that implements a user’s commands via a CLI, acting like a bridge between the user and the operating system’s internal functions.\nMost OS’s (Linux, Mac, and Windows) have a built-in command-line program:\n\nthe PowerShell on Windows.\n\nSearch PowerShell and open it (without activating a conda environment which will be discussed below).\nOr, install PowerShell Prompt in Anaconda and run it in the virtual environment (activating it).\n\nthe Terminal on macOS\n\nSearch “Terminal” and open it\nTerminal User Guide\n\nthe Terminal on Linux\n\nSearch “Terminal” (the default Bash and open it\nThe Linux command line for beginners\nUsingTheTerminal - Ubuntu documantation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2.1 Installing Anaconda\nInstalling Anaconda Distribution is the official website for the installation, in which the step-by-step procedure is documented well.\n\n\n2.3.2.2 Creating a Virtual Environment\nOnce you open the installed Anaconda on your computer, you start the Anaconda GUI on the base environment where your OS directly interact and that it is recommended not to use for projects. Instead of working on the base, let’s create a new one.\nTo do that, let’s open a terminal\n\nIn Windows, any prompt on the Anaconda GUI (e.g., Powershell Prompt, CMD.exe Prompt, or anaconda_prompt) — Not directly from Windows\nIn macOS/Linux, the OS’s terminal\n\nIn the terminal’s prompt, you should have (base) that indicates the current environment.\nA new environment with a name buda450_py311 can be created with the following command:\nconda create --name buda450_py311\nIn the command, you can replace buda450_py311 with the name you want for the environment.
