    "section": "1.2 What is Data Mining?",
    "text": "1.2 What is Data Mining?\n\n1.2.1 Fuels for the Information Age\nTo understand data mining, let’s first start by answering the question What exactly is data mining? There is a famous analogy from “Clive Humby, a British mathematician and entrepreneur, that said, ‘Data is the new oil.’ This analogy helps us understand why data mining is such a crucial process in the modern information age.\nWhat does that mean? Just like crude oil, raw data on its own isn’t very useful. Crude oil has to be refined into products like gasoline, plastic, or jet fuel to be valuable. Similarly, data has to be refined—through cleaning, processing, and analysis—before it generates value.\nThe Information Age has been built on this process. In the past, major waves of development were driven by steam, electricity, and oil. Now, computers, networks, and data form the foundation of progress. Think about it: every time you use Google Maps, watch Netflix, or buy something on Amazon, you’re experiencing data as fuel. Those companies don’t just store data—they refine it into insights: recommending the next show, predicting traffic, or suggesting products.\n\n\n1.2.2 Data Mining in Simple Terms\nAt its simplest, data mining means turning raw data into value. You can think of it as a process of discovering hidden patterns and relationships from data. In the process,\n\nData is the raw material. Think of sales receipts, website clicks, or medical records.\nMining is the process—digging into that data to find useful patterns. Just like miners dig into rock to find gold, we dig into data to find knowledge.\nValue is the outcome, as insights that help us make a difference such as better decisions, efficiency improvement, or predictions.\n\nHere’s a business example: imagine a supermarket chain. They have massive amounts of checkout data. By itself, it’s just numbers. But when mined, it might reveal that customers who buy diapers also buy beer. That insight has value—it can influence store layout or promotions.\nSo whenever you hear the term data mining, think: data goes in, and actionable value comes out. In short: data in, value out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThink of a situation: You’ve got tons of information, but it’s just sitting there. What’s one example where mining that information could turn it into value?\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Definition of Data Mining\nData mining is the knowledge discovery from data. It’s the process of extracting interesting patterns or knowledge from huge datasets.\nLet’s highlight a few key parts of that definition: - Interesting means non-trivial—it’s not something obvious. - It should be previously unknown. If everyone already knows it, it’s not knowledge discovery. - And it should be useful—either for making predictions, guiding strategy, or saving resources.\nData mining goes by other names too: knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), knowledge extraction, business intelligence, information harvesting. Besides, there are many but similar and related definitions of data mining, like data analysis and data dredging.\nBut, here, the important distinction is this: data mining is not about finding any pattern—it’s about finding meaningful and valid patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you notice that every morning the sun rises in the east, does that count as data mining? Why or why not? (Hint: it’s not new or unknown!)\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Foundations of Data Mining\nWe just started studying Data mining in this course, but data mining is not a brand-new discipline—it borrows from several established fields. Here are three major fields.\n\nDatabase systems and computing: Without advances in storing and managing large amounts of data, mining would not be possible. Think about SQL databases or distributed systems like Hadoop.\nStatistics: This provides the foundation for measurement, inference, and testing. For example, probability theory underlies many mining methods.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML): These give us algorithms that learn patterns from data, like decision trees, clustering, and neural networks.\n\nNow, we may have one following question: why do we need something beyond traditional statistics or databases? Because modern data has new challenges:\n\nIt’s complex—your task may involve not only well-structured tabular format but also, text, video, images, not just numbers. The traditional methods often are not suitable for data mining tasks with such complex data.\nSimilarly, modern data are often heterogeneous—as it may consist of different formats and sources.\nIn addition, data for your tasks may be at a large-scale with millions or billions of records, and high-dimensional with thousands of variables.\nFurthermore, data can be distributed as stored across many servers and locations.\n\nTraditional techniques simply weren’t built to handle this. Data mining techniques evolved to tackle exactly these challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCan you think of one dataset you’ve encountered—maybe in your work, studies, or even social media—that seems too big or too complex to handle with just Excel or basic statistics?",

    "section": "1.3 Why is data mining used?",
    "text": "1.3 Why is data mining used?\n\n1.3.1 Data and its Explosive Growth\nHere’s the big driver behind why data mining matters: the sheer explosion of data. Data is everywhere, and it keeps growing faster than we can imagine. This growth is driven by advances in:\n\nData generation – Every second, people are generating posts, clicks, videos, GPS pings, and transactions.\nData collection – Sensors, apps, and platforms record nearly everything.\nData storage – Cloud computing now makes it cheap to keep almost unlimited amounts of data.\n\nWe’ve moved from terabytes (10¹² bytes) to petabytes, exabytes, and now zettabytes (10¹⁸ bytes). To give you perspective, one zettabyte is a billion terabytes.\nThe sources of this data are diverse:\n\nBusiness: Online purchases, stock trades, loyalty cards.\nSociety: Social media posts, news feeds, YouTube uploads.\nScience: Remote sensing data from satellites, DNA sequencing, simulation models.\n\nLike these, nowadays, we can collect data nearly everywhere. Here, the reality is–—we’re in an era where we generate more data than we can manually process. That’s why data mining isn’t optional anymore; it’s necessary to make sense of the flood of information.\nExample: Domo’s annual Data Never Sleeps report shows that in just one minute, millions of emails are sent, hundreds of thousands of dollars are spent on e-commerce, and hours of video are uploaded to YouTube. This highlights the nonstop pace of data growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n‘Think about your own life for a moment—your phone, your social media, your browsing history. How much data do you think you generate in a single day? Is most of it being used, or just stored?’”\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Value from Data and Data Mining\nNow, here’s the critical point: while data is everywhere, value is not. Collecting data doesn’t guarantee it will be useful to create value. Keep in mind that our goal of data mining here is not to create data, but to create value. To achieve it, we can consider two main ways:\n\nFor its intended purpose.\n\nExample: a hospital records patient vital signs so doctors can monitor health.\n\nFor a new, unanticipated purpose.\n\nExample: analyzing purchase data not just for receipts, but to build customer recommendation systems.\n\n\nData mining is the bridge that transforms massive raw data into valuable insights. Then, what makes this possible today?\n\nFirst, we have now cheaper and more powerful computing. Cloud platforms and GPUs let us crunch massive datasets quickly.\nAt the same time, there are competitive pressure. Companies must use their data to stay ahead—think of how Netflix, Amazon, or Spotify personalize services to keep customers engaged.\n\nReal-world example: Netflix doesn’t just track what you watch; it tracks when you pause, when you stop, how often you binge, and even the time of day you watch. By do data mining, that raw data becomes insights that guide personalized recommendations and even influence what original shows they invest in. So the real message here is: without mining, data is just overhead. However, with data mining, it can become a strategic asset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHere’s a question: Can you think of an example where you know a company is using your data to give you personalized value—like a recommendation, an offer, or an alert? Did it feel helpful or a little creepy?",

    "text": "1.4 When/where is data mining needed?\n\n1.4.1 Process for DM\nData mining isn’t just one single action—it’s part of a larger process that requires careful planning and execution. At its core, data mining means examining large datasets to identify patterns and then using those patterns to generate valuable business insights. But if we just jump into modeling without structure, we risk wasting time or drawing wrong conclusions.\nThat’s why a systematic approach is critical. In industry, there are established standards with clearly defined steps, the two most popular being: - CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) - KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) process\nBoth provide a roadmap, ensuring that projects move from messy raw data to actionable insights in a repeatable and reliable way.\nAlso, remember that data mining is part of a broader data analytics ecosystem that includes machine learning, statistical analysis, and business intelligence tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nImagine you’re hired by a company that wants to reduce customer churn. What could go wrong if you just start building a model without following a systematic process?\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)\nCRISP-DM is one of the most widely used frameworks for data mining. It consists of six iterative steps:\n\nBusiness understanding – First, we define the context and objectives. What problem are we solving? For example: predicting loan defaults.\nData understanding – Collect raw data and perform preliminary analysis. What data do we have? What’s missing? What hypotheses are emerging?\nData preparation – Clean, transform, and preprocess data. This includes removing errors, handling missing values, and selecting useful variables.\nModeling – Apply appropriate data mining techniques, like classification, clustering, or regression.\nEvaluation – Assess the models. Are the results valid? Do they answer the business question? If not, we loop back.\nDeployment – Translate results into actionable insights or strategies. For example: build a dashboard, send alerts, or automate decision rules.\n\nIt’s important to note that CRISP-DM is not linear. Analysts often move back and forth between stages as new discoveries are made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n‘Looking at these six steps, which do you think might take the most time in a real project: modeling or data preparation?’ (Hint: in practice, data preparation usually eats up the majority of time!)”\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Knowledge Discovery (KDD) Process\nThe KDD process is another structured framework, often discussed in academic and research communities, especially those focused on databases and data warehousing. The KDD steps look very similar to CRISP-DM but are framed slightly differently: - Data selection – From large databases, choose relevant subsets. - Preprocessing – Clean and prepare the data. - Transformation – Reduce dimensions, select features, normalize variables. - Data mining – Apply algorithms to extract patterns. - Interpretation and evaluation – Translate patterns into useful knowledge.\nSo while CRISP-DM is popular in business practice, KDD is the more theoretical backbone you would often see in academic papers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy do you think industry and academia developed slightly different process models for the same overall idea?",

    "section": "1.5 How can data mining be used?",
    "text": "1.5 How can data mining be used?\nLet’s look at the typical tasks of data mining.\nHere’s a sample dataset—things like refund status, marital status, income, and whether someone cheats on taxes. From a dataset like this, what kinds of tasks might we perform?\n\nPredictive modeling: Can we predict whether someone is likely to cheat, given their attributes?\nClustering: Can we group taxpayers into categories—like high risk, medium risk, low risk—without labels?\nAnomaly detection: Can we find cases that look suspiciously different from the rest?\nAssociation rules: Can we uncover relationships—for example, divorced individuals with high income are more or less likely to cheat?\n\nEach of these tasks aligns with a type of real-world decision problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n‘Looking at this small tax dataset, what question would you want to ask first? Prediction, clustering, or anomaly detection?’”\n\n\n\n1.5.1 Predictive Modeling\n“redictive modeling is one of the most powerful applications of data mining. The idea is simple: we use training data—examples where the outcomes are known—to build a model that captures the relationship between inputs (features) and outputs (labels). Then, we apply that model to new, unseen data to predict outcomes.\nThis applies across many domains: - In finance: predicting loan defaults. - In marketing: predicting customer churn. - In healthcare: predicting disease risk.\nWe’ll focus on two main branches:\n\nClassification – when outcomes are categorical.\nRegression – when outcomes are numerical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCan you think of a business scenario where we would want to predict a number, and another where we’d want to predict a category?\n\n\n\n1.5.1.1 Predictive Modeling: Classification\nClassification is about predicting non-numerical categorical labels.\nExample: Think about a bank monitoring transactions. Classification models flag suspicious transactions as ‘fraud’ or ‘not fraud.’\nThere are many methods: decision trees, naïve Bayes, support vector machines, neural networks, logistic regression, and rule-based approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n‘How many of you have had a credit card transaction declined because the bank thought it was suspicious? That’s classification in action—sometimes right, sometimes wrong!’”\n\n\n\n\n1.5.1.2 Predictive Modeling: Regression\nRegression is similar to classification, but here the outcome is numerical. We use regression when we want to predict values like:\n\nFuture sales for a product.\nThe price of a house.\nThe index of a stock market.\n\nExample: A real estate company might use regression to predict house prices based on features like square footage, neighborhood, and number of bedrooms.\nMethods include multiple linear regression, Poisson regression, kernel regression, and support vector regression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n‘If Amazon wants to predict how many units of a new product will sell next month, is that classification or regression?’”\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Clustering\nClustering is about grouping data points into clusters without prior labels. Unlike predictive models where labels are predefined and given for training, clustering discovers categories automatically. Applications include:\n\nMarket segmentation: Grouping customers by behavior or preferences.\nDocument clustering: Grouping related news articles.\nStock market analysis: Grouping stocks with similar trends.\nSummarization: Reducing large datasets into manageable categories.\n\nMethods include k-means, hierarchical clustering, and density-based clustering.\nExample: A retailer could use clustering to identify customer segments—like bargain hunters, premium buyers, or occasional shoppers—without knowing those groups beforehand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThink about Spotify or Apple Music. How do you think clustering helps them group songs or users?\n\n\n\n\n1.5.3 Anomaly Detection\nAnomaly detection is about identifying outliers—cases that deviate significantly from normal patterns. This is incredibly important in practice: - Fraud detection: spotting unusual credit card transactions. - Cybersecurity: detecting intrusions or abnormal network activity. - Healthcare: identifying abnormal patient vitals that signal a problem.\nMethods include statistical tests, clustering-based detection (points far from any cluster), and machine learning methods like one-class support vector machines and neural networks.\nExample: If a customer normally spends $50–$100 per purchase, but suddenly makes a $10,000 purchase in another country, that’s flagged as an anomaly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n‘If your Netflix account suddenly started watching cartoons all night long—would that be an anomaly worth investigating?’”\n\n\n\n\n1.5.4 Association Rule Analysis\nAssociation rule analysis is about discovering dependencies between items.\nThe classic example is market-basket analysis: - Rule: {Diapers, Milk} → {Beer}. - This means customers who buy diapers and milk are likely to also buy beer.\nMethods include Apriori algorithm and pattern discovery approaches. Applications extend beyond retail: Telecom: Diagnosing alarms based on combinations of error codes.; Healthcare: Identifying co-occurrence of symptoms or treatments.; E-commerce: Powering recommendation engines (‘People who bought this also bought…’).\nExample: On Amazon, when you see ‘Frequently Bought Together,’ that’s association rule mining in action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n‘Think about your own online shopping. Has an item ever been recommended to you that felt spot-on? That’s association rules at work.’”",

    "text": "1.6 Users of DM?\nWe have one last question to ask: who actually uses data mining? The short answer is: almost everyone. For example,\n\nAnalysts in various fields: Business analysts, data analysts, and market researchers use mining to guide decisions.\nScientists and engineers: They apply it in areas like bioinformatics, astronomy, materials science, and engineering simulations.\nBusinesses: Companies mine customer data to personalize services, detect fraud, and optimize operations.\nGovernments: For public policy, fraud detection, and even security monitoring.\nComputers and AI systems: Increasingly, automated pipelines powered by machine learning algorithms mine data in real time—think recommendation systems or self-driving cars.\n\nIn practice, much of this happens behind the scenes, through automation. For example, Google’s search engine mines billions of webpages continuously, and Netflix constantly mines viewing data to refine recommendations.\nAnd let’s not forget—you! As students in this class, you’re training to become the next generation of professionals who will design, interpret, and apply these data mining techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n‘Quick brainstorm: Can you name one profession or industry that you think will rely even more on data mining in the next 5–10 years?’”",
